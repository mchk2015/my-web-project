
I don・t think I・ve ever actually written out a Document Type Declaration or
doctype. I・ve cut-and-pasted one more times than I can remember, but usually
I let my HTML editor insert one for me.

HTML5・s doctype is short and simple. No version number, no language, no URI:
<!DOCTYPE html>

HTML5・s doctype is case-insensitive too, so we can write it as <!doctype html> ,
<!DOCTYPE html> or even <!Doctype HTML> .

Doctypes weren・t intended to be read by humans, and not even browsers
really need them, except to ．switch doctype・ between their quirks and
standards modes. In fact, we could leave out a doctype altogether and our
documents would still be valid HTML5.

The doctype isn・t the only thing that・s got shorter in HTML5: character
encoding has too. Here・s a meta element for a document written in HTML 4.01:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
This is shortened in HTML5 to just:
<meta charset="UTF-8">

We now needn・t specify a type value of text/css on every link to every style
sheet. We can simply write:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">

Because browsers don・t need it, we can forget text/javascript applied to
scripts too, and simply write:
<script src="modernizr-1.5.js"></script>

HTML5 isn・t fussy about how we write our markup either. Whether we like
lower case, upper case or mixed case HTML elements, we can use our preferred
style in HTML5. If we learned to write XHTML 1.0-style lower case elements,
that・s fine in HTML5 too. Whether we self-close images or not, or use quote
marks around our attributes or not, HTML5 won・t mind. Neither will browsers,
so we can carry on writing HTML in whatever style we prefer.
