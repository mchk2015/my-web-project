				<h4 id="0001a">What is 'Racism' and how do you account for its 
				persistence in modern societies?</h4>
				<div class="BAWEWriting">
				<p>Racism is still a problem within our society today, and many ethnic minorities face inequalities in many areas, including education, housing, and employment. Ethnic minorities are concentrated into certain areas of the job market, such as manufacture and communication (Brown, 1992), are most likely to be the victims of assault (Abercrombie et al, 1994), and recent surveys have shown that racist ideas still exist in society. This can be seen in a survey, carried out in 1993, that asked a white sample whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement: 'Immigration has enriched the quality of life in Britain' and nearly half of the sample disagreed (Abercrombie et al, 1994, p255).

				In this essay I will look at what racism is, and how it is defined in contemporary society, and I will then explore why it still persists. In this section I will cover three areas that I think have contributed to the continued existence of racism; culture, economy and politics, all of which have meant that racism is an integral and internalised part of our society, however I will not be looking at individual or specific cases of racism, rather exploring a broader explanation as to why it continues.

				Racism is a very hard concept to define. Hall argues that it is not a static phenomenon, but is constantly changing and redefining (Hall, 1978, cited in Miles, 1989, p64). In the nineteenth century racism was a product of scientific ideas, and the belief that people could be distinguished by the term race, using particular physical features, and that certain races were superior to others (Miles, 1989). However throughout the nineteenth century racism was rejected as a scientific concept (Banton, 1987, cited in Miles, 1989, p49). It is now important to realise that racism is not just an ideology but also a practice, and in contemporary society it has been defined as a process by which subordinated groups are excluded. This idea is expanded on by Carmichael and Hamilton who argue that it is; 'the predication of decisions and policies on considerations of race for the purpose of subordinating a racial group and maintaining control over that group' (Carmichael and Hamilton, 1968, cited in Miles, 1989, p51). This acknowledges that racism is not just a belief, but also an action, but in this essay I will concentrate on why the ideology of racism is still prevalent within society, as without the continuation of the ideology then racist actions would not take place.

				I will now look at why racism still persists in society, and the first explanation I will consider is culture. Racist beliefs are part of a legacy of both the slave trade and colonialism as racial categorisation played a large part in the justification of both periods. The idea that humankind was split into different races and that certain races, usually white British, were superior was strong at the time, and reinforced to justify slavery and imperialism. These ideas have left a strong legacy in coloniser societies today (Fenton, 1999). Europeans constructed themselves as the representatives of superior civilisation, and in doing so also constructed those from other countries as the 'Other', a group of people who were uncivilised, and therefore inferior to the West, an idea that was reinforced through literature, as many travellers at the time focused on the abnormal characteristics of the 'Other', and helped construct the idea that they were barbaric and uncivilised (Miles, 1989). Characteristics such as cannibalism and the degradation of women were picked out as features that made those from the colonised states racially inferior, and uncivilised, and reinforced the idea that a racialist hierarchy existed that placed those from the West at the top. By defining people from these countries as the 'Other' they were automatically excluded from the society of the West (Miles, 1989).

				Although this construction is no longer as prevalent in society, it has impacted on racism in society today. Images and ideas that were associated with the 'Other', for example the veil in Islam, are still around today, and the racial ideas that were leant to these images still exist. There is also the idea that White Europeans wished to continue their superiority over colonised societies, so sustained the ideas associated with the inferior 'Other' in order to maintain it (Fenton, 1999). It can also be argued that racism persists through culture due to the ideas of nationalism. Nationalism is a very popular discourse in contemporary society, as it was during the period of colonialisation, and the two are very closely linked, with ideas of nationalism often associated with both the ideology and actions of racism (Fenton, 1999).

				Overall colonialism has impacted on the racist ideas prevalent in today's society, as although the concept of 'Other' that existed in the nineteenth century no longer continues the definition of 'Other' has changed (Miles, 1989), and it has left a legacy of racism in contemporary society. However this is not the only reason for the continuation of racism, economic factors have also had an impact.

				The racism apparent at the time of colonialisation has been reinforced through the labour market. During this period the racial ideas were put into practice in the economy as those constructed as the 'Other' were exploited through the trade links established with the colonies, by those in power (Miles, 1989) showing that racialism has been imbedded into the economy since before capitalism. However since the emergence of capitalism these racist ideas have been used to support the capitalist market. Capitalists have ensured that ethnic minorities are viewed as suitable only for menial jobs, as they can easily exploit them, and this has reinforced the idea that race determines your skills and abilities, therefore causing racism to be imbedded within the capitalist market (Fenton, 1999). Castles and Kosack have argued that capitalism requires a 'reserve army of labour' to ensure the successful continuation of the economic production along capitalist values, and that ethnic minorities provide this army (Procter, Lecture notes, 2004). However by constructing ethnic minorities as a reserve army of labour racist beliefs are reinforced, as they are viewed as both inferior and only suitable for inferior jobs, but also as a threat to the white workers, creating a sense of racism in white workers.

				Therefore the racist beliefs apparent in the culture of colonialism are recreated in the current economy, ensuring that racism persists, although there are some problems with this idea as it ignores the white people employed in menial jobs and over emphasises the idea that ethnic minorities are needed as a 'reserve army of labour' (Miles, 1989). However politics, and the policies of British political parties over the twentieth century have also ensured that these racial ideas continue.

				Since the Second World War British politics reinforced have the idea that those from other races are inferior. In the 1950s both the Labour and Conservative Parties were openly racist (Brown, 1992), and they constructed immigrants as a social problem. Throughout the 1950s the debates on immigration focused on the idea that the number of black immigrants entering Britain needed to be restricted as they were posing a threat to British society. Immigrants were linked with social problems, including shortages of housing and crime, and through this connection racism was reinforced, as people began to see immigrants and people from other races as a problem. Emphasis was put on their undesirable behaviour, for example crime, and prostitution, despite the fact that much of this was not carried out by immigrants (Solomos, 1989, ensuring that people linked the idea of undesirable with immigrants.

				This construction of immigrants as a problem continued throughout out the 1960s, and in 1962 the Commonwealth Immigrants Act was introduced, which placed restrictions on the number of black immigrants entering the country (Solomos, 1989). By the 1970s legislation had been bought in which controlled the entry of non-white immigrants through a voucher system, giving the government control over who entered the country, and what work they could do following their entry (Brown, 1992). This political racism persisted after 1979, with Margaret Thatcher again emphasising the danger to British society that immigrants pose (Solomos, 1989), and these ideas can still be seen today, with the current clamp-down on the number of asylum seekers entering the country.

				Overall the policies of the government since the Second World War have made racism an integral part of our society, and ensured that non-whites are still viewed with distaste and seen as inferior.

				In conclusion racism, which can be defined as an ideology which categorises people as inferior according to their race, and is put into practice through many policies and actions, which seek to exclude non-whites from many areas of society, can still be seen in today's society. There are three reasons for this. Firstly the culture of colonialism and the belief that the 'Other' is inferior is still apparent in our society today. Secondly these beliefs are reinforced through the economy, as capitalism exploits ethnic minorities, and ensures that they are viewed as less skilled, and finally racism is embedded in our political system through the policies of political parties and the links they make between non-white immigrants and social problems. All of these processes work together in contemporary society to ensure that racism still continues, and non-whites are excluded.

			<h3>Sociological Imagination and Investigation</h3>
			<article class="title">
				<h4 id="0001b">Explore the limitations and uses of official statistics, 
				using the internal and radical approaches, and conclude should 
				sociologists use official statistics?</h4>
				<div class="BAWEWriting">
				<p>Official statistics are those produced by either the state, or by one of its agencies. There has been a huge increase in the number of official statistics since the Central Statistics Office was set up in 1941, and now large quantities of statistics are produced on a variety of different topics, for example income, housing and population. Although they are widely used there are many limitations of the use of official statistics in sociology.

				In this essay I plan to talk about how the internal, or posivitist schools view statistics, looking at how they are critical of the reliability and validity of official statistics, and also how they feel that the processes involved in producing the statistics limit their uses. I will also explore the uses that statistics do have in sociology, and come to a conclusion on whether they should be use or not.

				The internal school of thought emphasises the need for reliability and validity in order to produce realistic statistics, however there are many problems with official statistics in this aspect, and as Hindess points out "they cannot be taken as a...reliable account" (Hindess, 1973). The term reliability refers to whether the statistics are replicable or not, and validity is defined as whether they paint a true picture of what they are looking at, and there are many problems with regards to both.

				The first problem is that of the definition of concept, and can cause problems with the reliability of the statistics. Different people define concepts in different ways so this alters the reliability of the study, and also means that readers may interpret the statistics in a different way to that which they were intended (Hindess, 1973, Shipman, 1973, May, 1997). Hindess points out that if concepts are defined differently it can have a huge result on the statistics (Hindess, 1973, cited in Irvine et al, 1979), and in Demystifying Statistics Irvine uses the example of unemployment, claiming that over the past three decades the definition of unemployment has altered many times, and this has big impact on the number of people who are defined as unemployed, according to the statistics (Irvine and Miles, 1979).

				The next problem is linked to validity. Official statistics go through a long process of decision making before the final result is reached (Hindess, 1973, May, 1997), even down to what methodology is used, and this process can alter the results greatly. In Social Research May uses the example of crime statistics to show this. The first decision in the process here is that of what is a crime in terms of the law. This would have a huge impact on crime statistics, for example if marital rape was not illegal then the crime statistics of rape would be very different. The second decision is made by the victim of the crime; whether to report it or not, which means that the formation of official statistics is not just influenced by those composing them, but also by decisions made by those involved in the actual area (May, 1997).

				Human judgement is a key factor in this criticism, but as the decision process shows it is not just the judgement of those composing the statistics that is involved (Hindess, 1973). This means that as the process continues the statistics become further distorted as different people's views and decisions become involved. This idea can be illustrated using the example of suicide. The official statistics produced on this topic are not only influenced by those collating the statistics, but also by those determining the causes of death. This can be seen by the fact that in the past Catholic priests did not like to categorise the cause of a death as 'suicide', so the term 'natural cause' would have been used instead, resulting in a very different set of statistics in the end. Cicourel also supports this idea; however he takes it one step further by saying that these decisions are influenced by people's background experiences (Cicourel, cited in Hindess, 1973). This means that even if two people from the same organisation tried to collect the same results there would be complications as they have had different experiences.

				Overall this shows that reliability and validity are hard to establish in official statistics, due to the number of human decisions involved, and the different ways in which people apply concepts. However according to the radical approach there are more limitations with statistics.

				The radical approach tells us that us that official statistics tell us more about the state than they do the topics they are exploring, therefore statistics should be viewed as a construction, and as Irvine and Miles say; "statistics are not collected, but produced" (Irvine and Miles, 1979). Official statistics are not neutral perceptions of a topic, but instead reflect political agendas (Irvine and Miles, 1979) and the aims of those with political power (May, 1997). One example of this is the way in which the government produced official statistics relating to unemployment under Margaret Thatcher. During her time in power the definition of unemployment changed over twenty times, as the aim of the statistics was to show how unemployment was decreasing, and the most successful way in which to achieve this was to alter the definition of the concept of unemployment. This shows how the aims and motives of those collecting the data can influence the final statistics.

				Radical thinkers also believe that statistics only tell us about the groups in society who hold power, and are simply a reflection of the balances of power in society (Hesteretal, 1996, cited in May, 1997). Official statistics do not exist on all topics that sociologists may want to look at, and as a result can be very limiting for them, but also only present a one sided view of society. One example of this is servants in the Victorian era. Many statistics from this time were produced by those in positions of power, for example mistresses, so they tell us little about the lives of the servants, who were working class and held little power.

				However, despite these limitations official statistics do have some uses. According to posivitists as long as the statistics are reliable and valid then hey are very useful, and one example of this is birth and death rates. As the registration of births and deaths are legal requirements the statistics are reliable, and paint a valid picture of the contemporary and past population levels. Statistics that are not produced using legal requirements can also be useful, however. Bulmer claims that statisticians often go to many lengths to avoid problems with reliability and validity, and he claims that as a result official statistics pose no more of a problem than sociological research. He also argues that if sufficient thought is given to the production of official statistics, and more scientific, rather than theoretical concepts are used, then these problems can be corrected, however it is hard to apply this to sociological research (Bulmer, 1984, cited in May, 1997).

				Using the radical approach statistics can be useful to tell us about the state and those in power, and what they are interested in. However radicals argue that if the processes involved in the construction of official statistics are carefully considered when analysing the results then the statistics can be seen to present a useful and valid picture of society (Hindess, 1973). However radicals also argue that official statistics are used most successfully, and paint the most realistic picture when they are combined with another method (May, 1997), for example self report studies when the topic of crime is being studied, as this allows the decision making process involved in the official statistics to be balanced out, as people are more likely to be honest in a self report study.

				Overall, according to the posivitists the main limitations of official statistics arise from the issues of reliability and validity, however they feel that in many cases these limitations are overcome by careful planning, so argue that sociologists should use official statistics. Radicals on the other hand, believe that official statistics are a construction of the state, and this means that although they are useful for examining the state and its interests they do not provide a realistic picture of society.

				I feel sociologists should use official statistics especially when examining those with power, or exploring the state, however they should treat official statistics produced on other topics with care, and be aware of the process of decision making and methodology that occurs before the statistics are finally produced.
